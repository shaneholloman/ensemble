# Changelog

## Unreleased
- Sent OpenAI image idempotency keys as an explicit wire header, added a redacted live image-edit trace, and retained upload filenames, media types, and byte counts in request logs without storing raw image payloads.
- Refreshed runtime and development dependencies to current compatible releases, including OpenAI 6.46, Anthropic 0.111, Google GenAI 2.11, Vitest 4.1.10, and ESLint 10.7; TypeScript remains on the latest TypeDoc-compatible 6.x release.
- Extended the OpenAI image deadline across source downloads, file preparation, request logging, and provider dispatch so preparation cannot strand an image edit before the guarded request begins.
- Hardened OpenAI image generation and editing with an outer wall-clock deadline, abort propagation, disabled hidden SDK retries, stable idempotency controls, provider request-id metadata, and structured content-policy/error classification so non-settling requests and refusals are observable to callers.
- Added FAL support for Seedream 5.0 Pro/Lite text-to-image (`bytedance/seedream/v5/pro`, `bytedance/seedream/v5/lite`) and Ideogram V4 instant/fast (`ideogram/v4/instant`, `ideogram/v4/fast`) with endpoint-specific routing and current pricing metadata.
- Added xAI Grok 4.5 (`grok-4.5`) metadata, current aliases (`grok-4.5-latest`, `grok-build-latest`), class defaults, cached-token pricing, and Chat Completions `reasoning_effort` mapping.
- Added Gemini 3.5 Flash (`gemini-3.5-flash`) provider metadata, pricing, and native Gemini thinking-level suffix handling.
- Added Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite Image (`gemini-3.1-flash-lite-image`) support and promoted current Gemini image model IDs (`gemini-3.1-flash-image`, `gemini-3-pro-image`, `gemini-2.5-flash-image`) while preserving preview IDs as aliases.
- Updated Gemini image pricing, provider routing, grounding support, and thinking controls for the current stable Gemini image model family.
- Mapped Gemini native thinking suffixes `-none`, `-disabled`, `-minimal`, `-low`, `-medium`, `-high`, `-max`, and `-xhigh` to provider `thinkingLevel` values where supported.
- Translated `modelSettings.thinking_budget` to native Gemini `thinkingLevel` values for Gemini 3/3.5 models while keeping numeric `thinkingBudget` for Gemini 2.5 models.

## 2026-05-19

- Added FAL slash-path endpoint mapping and explicit `fal-ai/image2svg` support with one-source-image request handling, SVG output extraction, and $0.005 per-image pricing metadata.
